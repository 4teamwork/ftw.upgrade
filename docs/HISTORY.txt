Changelog
=========


1.8.0 (2014-08-11)
------------------

- Prevent portal_quickinstaller from picking upgrade-steps instead of the
  default-profile by prefixing the profile-id with 'upgrade_to_' (fix #45)
  [pbauer]

- Flag profiles whose filesystem version is outdated.
  Highlights profiles with upgrades that lead to a destination version that is
  higher than the corresponding profile's current filesystem version.
  This usually means someone forgot to update the version in metadata.xml of the
  corresponding profile.
  [lgraf]


1.7.4 (2014-05-12)
------------------

- Extend workflow updater to migrate workflow history.
  [jone]

- Fix workflow updater to always update objects.
  The objects are updated even when it seems that the object was
  not update or has no longer a workflow.
  This fixes issues when updating a workflow, in which case the
  old workflow and the new workflow has the same ID.
  [jone]

- Make sure the transaction note does not get too long.
  Zope limits the transaction note length. By actively managing the transaction note
  we can provide fallbacks for when it gets too long because a lot of upgrade steps
  are installed at the same time.
