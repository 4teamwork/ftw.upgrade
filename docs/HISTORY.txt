1.16.2 (2016-01-15)
-------------------

- Actually the same as 1.16.1, but pypi was broken when I
  released it and now it does not let me use the same version
  number. :-(
  [jone]


1.16.1 (2016-01-13)
-------------------

- Added documentation for the additions of the previous release.  [maurits]


1.16.0 (2016-01-05)
-------------------

- Added ``--all-sites`` option.  This iterates over all sites and
  performs the specified command on each of them.  A failing command
  for one site will stop the entire command.  [maurits]

- Configure logging for the command line utility.  By default print
  only our own logging, on info level or higher.  With the new
  ``--verbose`` option print all loggers (so also from other packages
  like ``requests``) at debug level and higher.  [maurits]

- Added ``plone_upgrade`` command to upgrade a Plone Site.  This is
  what you would manually do in the ``@@plone-upgrade`` view.  [maurits]

- Added support for installing profiles.  Profiles are only applied
  once.  Example command line: ``bin/upgrade install --site Plone
  --profiles Products.PloneFormGen:default``.  [maurits]

- Prevented UnicodeEncodeError when piping output of ``bin/upgrade
  sites``.  This would fail when a site had non-ascii characters in
  its title.  [maurits]

  Before only "instance*" was supported.

1.14.3 (2015-03-29)
-------------------

- Fix error in upgrade-step:directory directive.
  The error occured when the directory was a subdirectory relative to the
  ZCML directory, causing the package module to be replaced with the
  upgrades package directory in sys.modules.
  [jone]

- Fix issue with transaction note length when a large not already exists.
  When the transaction note already has maximum length (e.g. with Archetypes notes),
  nothing more should be added.
  Also increased the threshold back (reduced in 1.14.2).
  [jone]


1.14.2 (2015-03-25)
-------------------

- Reduce maximum transaction note length used by ftw.upgrade.
  [jone]

- Command: fix instance discover when bound to public interface.
  [jone]


1.14.0 (2015-02-24)

  [jone]


1.12.0 (2015-02-16)

  This makes it possible to install upgrades from the console.
  [jone]

- Update upgrade step scaffold to support plone.reload.
  [jone]

- New JSON API implemented, accessible with `/upgrades-api`.
  [jone]

- Executioner: `install_upgrades_by_api_ids` was added, allowing to install
  a selection of upgrades identified by API ugprade ids.
  [jone]

- Gatherer: `get_upgrades_by_api_ids` was added, returning upgrade infos
  for a selection of API upgrade ids.
  [jone]

- Gatherer: `get_upgrades` is deprecated and replaced by `get_profiles`.
  `get_profiles` now has a `proposed_only` flag.
  [jone]


1.11.0 (2015-01-08)
-------------------

- Reverse post upgrade adapter ordering.
  The order was reversed, it should execute dependencies first.
  [jone]

- create-upgrade: Make sure to quote argument passed to bin/upgrade.
  [lgraf]

- Add a ``create-upgrade`` script which can be installed globally.
  [jone]

- Create a ``bin/upgrade`` script:

  - the ``create`` command creates a upgrade step in the "upgrades" directory.
  - the ``touch`` command can be used for reordering upgrade steps.

  [jone]

- New ``upgrade-step:directory`` directive for registering a directory
  with upgrade steps which are automatically detected and registered.
  [jone]

- Extend the importProfile directive so that a handler can be
  defined. The handler may import the associated upgrade step
  profile with the new method ``self.install_upgrade_profile()``.
  [jone]


1.10.2 (2014-11-19)
-------------------

- Exclude uninstalled products from upgrades view.
  [jone]

- Make upgrades appear in undo form again.
  The transaction note fix in 1.7.4 caused upgrade transaction to not appear in the undo form.
  [jone]


1.10.1 (2014-10-27)
-------------------

- Update upgrade view ordering for root nodes.
  The dependency graph does not define any order for root
  profiles (e.g. included in buildout directly), which causes
  random sorting in the upgrade view for those profiles.
  This change sorts those root profiles by name without changing
  the order of profiles which is depended on.
  [jone]


1.10.0 (2014-08-28)
-------------------

- Wrap step.objects in a SavepointIterator that creates a savepoint every n items.
  [lgraf]


1.9.0 (2014-08-27)
------------------

- Add @@manage-upgrades-plain fallback view for @@manage-upgrades.
  It does not include plone`s main template and thus might be able to render when
  the default view fails for some reason.
  [deiferni]


1.8.0 (2014-08-11)
------------------

- Prevent portal_quickinstaller from picking upgrade-steps instead of the
  default-profile by prefixing the profile-id with ``upgrade_to_`` (fix #45)
  [pbauer]

- Flag profiles whose filesystem version is outdated.
  Highlights profiles with upgrades that lead to a destination version that is
  higher than the corresponding profile's current filesystem version.
  This usually means someone forgot to update the version in metadata.xml of the
  corresponding profile.
  [lgraf]


1.7.4 (2014-05-12)
------------------

- Extend workflow updater to migrate workflow history.
  [jone]

- Fix workflow updater to always update objects.
  The objects are updated even when it seems that the object was
  not update or has no longer a workflow.
  This fixes issues when updating a workflow, in which case the
  old workflow and the new workflow has the same ID.
  [jone]

- Make sure the transaction note does not get too long.
  Zope limits the transaction note length. By actively managing the transaction note
  we can provide fallbacks for when it gets too long because a lot of upgrade steps
  are installed at the same time.
  [jone]


1.7.3 (2014-04-30)
------------------

- Add ``uninstall_product`` method to upgrade step class.
  [jone]

  iterating over a catalog result.
  [jone]

- Implement new ``importProfile`` directive for creating upgrade steps
  that just import a specific upgrade step generic setup profile.
  [jone]


1.5 (2013-08-16)
----------------

- Add a ``WorkflowChainUpdater`` for changing workflow chains without
  resetting existing objects to the initial review state of the new
  workflow.
  [jone]


1.4.0 (2013-07-18)
------------------

- Added helper for adding a type_action.
  [phgross]

  and doing stuff with progress logging combined.
  [jone]

  [jone]

  [jone]

  [jone]

- Handle profiles of packages which were removed but have leftover generic setup entries.
  [jone]


1.0 (2012-08-13)
----------------

- Add installed upgrades to transaction note. Closes #7
  [jone]
