Introduction
============

This product aims to simplify running and writing third-party Generic Setup
upgrade steps in Plone.

It provides a control panel for running multiple upgrades
at once, based on the upgrade mechanism of Generic Setup (portal_setup).

Further a base class for writing upgrade steps with a variety of
helpers for common tasks is provided.

Features
========

* **Managing upgrades**: Provides an advanced view for upgrading
  third-party Plone packages using Generic Setup.
  It allows to upgrade multiple packages at once with an easy to use user
  interface.
  By resolving the dependency graph it is able to optimize the upgrade
  step order so that the upgrade is hassle free.

* **Import profile upgrade steps**: Some times an upgrade step does simply
  import an upgrade step generic setup profile, especially made for this
  upgrade step. A new ZCML directive makes this much simpler.

* **Writing upgrades**: The package provides a base upgrade class with
  various helpers for tasks often done in upgrades.


Installation
============

- Install ``ftw.upgrade`` by adding it to the list of eggs in your buildout.
  Then run buildout and restart your instance:

.. code:: ini

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        ftw.upgrade


- Go to Site Setup of your Plone site and activate the ``ftw.upgrade`` add-on.

Import-Profile Upgrade Steps
============================

Sometimes an upgrade simply imports a little generic setup profile, which is only
made for this upgrade step. Doing such upgrade steps are often much simpler than doing
the change in python, because one can simply copy the necessary parts of the new
default generic setup profile into the upgrade step profile.

Normally, for doing this, one has to register an upgrade step and a generic setup
profile and write an upgrade step handler importing the profile.

ftw.upgrade makes this much simpler by providing an ``importProfile`` ZCML direvtive
especially for this specific use case.

Example ``configure.zcml`` meant to be placed in your ``upgrades`` sub-package:

.. code:: xml

    <configure
        xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:upgrade-step="http://namespaces.zope.org/ftw.upgrade"
        i18n_domain="my.package">

        <include package="ftw.upgrade" file="meta.zcml" />

        <upgrade-step:importProfile
            title="Update email_from_address"
            profile="my.package:default"
            source="1007"
            destination="1008"
            directory="profiles/1008"
            />

    </configure>

This example upgrade steps updates the ``email_from_address`` property.

A generic setup profile is automatically registered and hooked up with the
generated upgrade step handler.

Simply put a ``properties.xml`` in the folder ``profiles/1008`` relative to the
above ``configure.zcml`` and the upgrade step is ready for deployment.



Upgrade step helpers
====================

The ``UpgradeStep`` base class provides various tools and helpers useful
when writing upgrade steps.
It can be used by registering the classmethod directly.
Be aware that the class is very special: it acts like a function and calls
itself automatically.

Example upgrade step definition (defined in a ``upgrades.py``):

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade import UpgradeStep

    class UpdateFooIndex(UpgradeStep):
       """The index ``foo`` is a ``FieldIndex`` instead of a
       ``KeywordIndex``. This upgrade step changes the index type
       and reindexes the objects.
       """

       def __call__(self):
           index_name = 'foo'
           if self.catalog_has_index(index_name):
               self.catalog_remove_index(index_name)

           self.catalog_add_index(index_name, 'KeywordIndex')
           self.catalog_rebuild_index(index_name)


Registration in ``configure.zcml`` (assume its in the same directory):

.. code:: xml

    <configure
        xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:genericsetup="http://namespaces.zope.org/genericsetup"
        i18n_domain="my.package">

        <genericsetup:upgradeStep
            profile="my.package:default"
            source="4"
            destination="5"
            title="Update index 'foo'."
            handler=".upgrades.UpdateFooIndex"
            />

    </configure>


Updating objects with progress logging
--------------------------------------

Since an upgrade step often updates a set of objects indexed in the catalog,
there is a useful helper method combining querying the catalog with the
`ProgressLogger` (see below).
The catalog is queried unrestricted so that we handle all the objects.

Here is an example for updating all objects of a particular type:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade import ProgressLogger
    from ftw.upgrade import UpgradeStep

    class ExcludeFilesFromNavigation(UpgradeStep):

       def __call__(self):
           for obj in self.objects({'portal_type': 'File'},
                                   'Enable exclude from navigation for files'):
               obj.setExcludeFromNav(True)


When running the upgrade step you'll have a progress log::

    INFO ftw.upgrade STARTING Enable exclude from navigation for files
    INFO ftw.upgrade 1 of 10 (10%): Enable exclude from navigation for files
    INFO ftw.upgrade 5 of 50 (50%): Enable exclude from navigation for files
    INFO ftw.upgrade 10 of 10 (100%): Enable exclude from navigation for files
    INFO ftw.upgrade DONE: Enable exclude from navigation for files



Methods
-------

The ``UpgradeStep`` class has various helper functions:


``self.getToolByName(tool_name)``
    Returns the tool with the name ``tool_name`` of the upgraded site.

``self.objects(catalog_query, message, logger=None)``
    Queries the catalog (unrestricted) and an iterator with full objects.
    The iterator configures and calls a ``ProgressLogger`` with the
    passed ``message``.

``self.catalog_rebuild_index(name)``
    Reindex the ``portal_catalog`` index identified by ``name``.

``self.catalog_reindex_objects(query, idxs=None)``
    Reindex all objects found in the catalog with `query`.
    A list of indexes can be passed as `idxs` for limiting the
    indexed indexes.

``self.catalog_has_index(name)``
    Returns whether there is a catalog index ``name``.

``self.catalog_add_index(name, type_, extra=None)``
    Adds a new index to the ``portal_catalog`` tool.

``self.catalog_remove_index(name)``
    Removes an index to from ``portal_catalog`` tool.

``self.actions_remove_action(category, action_id)``
    Removes an action identified by ``action_id`` from
    the ``portal_actions`` tool from a particulary ``category``.

``self.catalog_unrestricted_get_object(brain)``
    Returns the unrestricted object of a brain.

``self.catalog_unrestricted_search(query, full_objects=False)``
    Searches the catalog without checking security.
    When `full_objects` is `True`, unrestricted objects are
    returned instead of brains.
    Upgrade steps should generally use unrestricted catalog access
    since all objects should be upgraded - even if the manager
    running the upgrades has no access on the objects.

``self.actions_remove_type_action(portal_type, action_id)``
    Removes a ``portal_types`` action from the type identified
    by ``portal_type`` with the action id ``action_id``.

``self.set_property(context, key, value, data_type='string')``
    Set a property with the key ``value`` and the value ``value``
    on the ``context`` safely.
    The property is created with the type ``data_type`` if it does not exist.

``self.add_lines_to_property(context, key, lines)``
    Updates a property with key ``key`` on the object ``context``
    adding ``lines``.
    The property is expected to by of type "lines".
    If the property does not exist it is created.

``self.setup_install_profile(profileid, steps=None)``
    Installs the generic setup profile identified by ``profileid``.
    If a list step names is passed with ``steps`` (e.g. ['actions']),
    only those steps are installed. All steps are installed by default.

``self.migrate_class(obj, new_class)``
    Changes the class of an object. It has a special handling for BTreeFolder2Base
    based containers.

``self.remove_broken_browserlayer(name, dottedname)``
    Removes a browser layer registration whose interface can't be imported any
    more from the persistent registry.
    Messages like these on instance boot time can be an indication for this
    problem:
    ``WARNING OFS.Uninstalled Could not import class 'IMyProductSpecific' from
    module 'my.product.interfaces'``

``self.update_security(obj, reindex_security=True)``
    Update the security of a single object (checkboxes in manage_access).
    This is usefuly in combination with the ``ProgressLogger``.
    It is possible to not reindex the object security in the catalog
    (``allowedRolesAndUsers``). This speeds up the update but should only be disabled
    when there are no changes for the ``View`` permission.

``self.update_workflow_security(workflow_names, reindex_security=True)``
    Update all objects which have one of a list of workflows.
    This is useful when updating a bunch of workflows and you want to make sure
    that the object security is updated properly.

    The update is done by doing as few as possibly by only searching for
    types which might have this workflow. It does support placeful workflow policies.

    For speeding up you can pass ``reindex_security=False``, but you need to make
    sure you did not change any security relevant permissions (only ``View`` for default
    Plone).



Progress logger
---------------

When an upgrade step is taking a long time to complete (e.g. while performing a data migration), the
administrator needs to have information about the progress of the update. It is also important to have
continuous output for avoiding proxy timeouts when accessing Zope through a webserver / proxy.

With the ``ProgressLogger`` it is very easy to log the progress:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade import ProgressLogger
    from ftw.upgrade import UpgradeStep

    class MyUpgrade(UpgradeStep):

       def __call__(self):
           objects = self.catalog_unrestricted_search(
               {'portal_type': 'MyType'}, full_objects=True)

           for obj in ProgressLogger('Migrate my type', objects):
               self.upgrade_obj(obj)

       def upgrade_obj(self, obj):
           do_something_with(obj)


The logger will log the current progress every 5 seconds (default).
Example log output::

    INFO ftw.upgrade STARTING Migrate MyType
    INFO ftw.upgrade 1 of 10 (10%): Migrate MyType
    INFO ftw.upgrade 5 of 50 (50%): Migrate MyType
    INFO ftw.upgrade 10 of 10 (100%): Migrate MyType
    INFO ftw.upgrade DONE: Migrate MyType


Workflow Chain Updater
----------------------

When the workflow is changed for a content type, the workflow state is
reset to the init state of new workflow for every existing object of this
type. This can be really annoying.

The `WorkflowChainUpdater` takes care of setting every object to the right
state after changing the chain (the workflow for the type):

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade.workflow import WorkflowChainUpdater
    from ftw.upgrade import UpgradeStep

    class UpdateWorkflowChains(UpgradeStep):

        def __call__(self):
            query = {'portal_type': ['Document', 'Folder']}
            objects = self.catalog_unrestricted_search(
                query, full_objects=True)

            review_state_mapping={
                ('intranet_workflow', 'plone_workflow'): {
                    'external': 'published',
                    'pending': 'pending'}}

            with WorkflowChainUpdater(objects, review_state_mapping):
                # assume that the profile 1002 does install a new workflow
                # chain for Document and Folder.
                self.setup_install_profile('profile-my.package.upgrades:1002')




Placeful Workflow Policy Activator
----------------------------------

When manually activating a placeful workflow policy all objects with a new
workflow might be reset to the initial state of the new workflow.

ftw.upgrade has a tool for enabling placeful workflow policies without
breaking the review state by mapping it from the old to the new workflows:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade.placefulworkflow import PlacefulWorkflowPolicyActivator
    from ftw.upgrade import UpgradeStep

    class ActivatePlacefulWorkflowPolicy(UpgradeStep):

        def __call__(self):
            portal_url = self.getToolByName('portal_url')
            portal = portal_url.getPortalObject()

            context = portal.unrestrictedTraverse('path/to/object')

            activator = PlacefulWorkflowPolicyActivator(context)
            activator.activate_policy(
                'local_policy',
                review_state_mapping={
                    ('intranet_workflow', 'plone_workflow'): {
                        'external': 'published',
                        'pending': 'pending'}})

The above example activates a placeful workflow policy recursively on the
object under "path/to/object", enabling the placeful workflow policy
"local_policy".

The mapping then maps the "intranet_workflow" to the "plone_workflow" by
defining which old states (key, intranet_workflow) should be changed to
the new states (value, plone_workflow).

**Options**

- `activate_in`: Activates the placeful workflow policy for the passed in
  object (`True` by default).
- `activate_below`: Activates the placeful workflow policy for the children
  of the passed in object, recursively (`True` by default).
- `update_security`: Update object security and reindex
  allowedRolesAndUsers (`True` by default).



IPostUpgrade adapter
====================

By registering an ``IPostUpgrade`` adapter it is possible to run custom code
after running upgrades.
All adapters are executed after each time upgrades were run, not depending on
which upgrades are run.
The name of the adapters should be the profile of the package, so that
``ftw.upgrade`` is able to execute the adapters in order of the GS dependencies.

Example adapter:

.. code:: python

    from ftw.upgrade.interfaces import IPostUpgrade
    from zope.interface import implements

    class MyPostUpgradeAdapter(object):
        implements(IPostUpgrade)

        def __init__(self, portal, request):
            self.portal = portal
            self.request = request

        def __call__(self):
            # custom code, e.g. import a generic setup profile for customizations

Registration in ZCML:

.. code:: xml

    <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
        <adapter
            factory=".adapters.MyPostUpgradeAdapter"
            provides="ftw.upgrade.interfaces.IPostUpgrade"
            for="Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.siteroot.IPloneSiteRoot
                 zope.interface.Interface"
            name="my.package:default" />
    </configure>
