    layer and errors are logged, the logging module might write to the logging
    handler in a thread after the request is finished.
    Since the testrunner tracks left over threads the logging thread is detected
    as leftover thread. Since this thread is a dummy thread it cannot be joined,
    which results in a error in the threading module (python 2.7 bug).
    The result is that from this test on the test log is spammed with threading
    errors for each following test.
    In order to mitigate this issue this context manager temporarily disables
    threading of logging in general so that logs are processed synchronously and
    no left over threads are created.
